# Cyber Forensics Fundamentals

- computer forensics
    - set of methodological procedures and techniques to help identify, preserve, extract, interpret, document adnf preserve evidence from computing equipment that is accepatble in a legal/administrative proceeding
    - objectives
        - identify, gather, preserve evidence
        - gather evidence in a forensically sound manner
        - assess the intent of the perpetrator
        - minimize losses to org
        - protect org from future incidents
    - need
        1. protect integirty and existence of IT infra in orgs
        2. collect evidence that proves attacker's actions in court
        3. efficiently track down perpetrators from different parts of the world
        4. protect org's financial resources and time
    - when is it used

        - estimate and minimize damages to corporate resources
        - set up security paramter/norms to ensure readiness
- cybercrimes
    - an illegal act involving a computing device, network, its sys or apps
    - types(based on the line of attack)
        - internal/insider
            - by an entrusted person with authorized access to the network 
        - external

- forensics investigator
    - need
        - cybercrime investigation
        - sound evidence handling
        - incident handling and response
    - roles + responsibilites
        - dtermiens extent of damage done
        - recovers data of investigative value
        - creates image of original evidence without rtamepring for integrity
        - guides investigating officals
    - features of a good investigator
        - good writing skills
        - strong analytical skills
        - has knowledge of laws with relevance to the case
        - knowledge of various tech, S/W and H/W
- computer forensics + legal compliance
    - legal compliance ensures that any evidence collected and analyzed is admissible in court

- forensic investigation
    - methodological approach to investigate, seize and analyze digital evidence and manage teh case from search to reporting the investigation result
    - importance
        - must ensure integrity
        - must compyly with local laws and established precedents
        - must follow a repeatable and well-docuemnted set of steps such taht every iteration provides the same findings
    - phases
        - pre-investigation
            - tasks to be performed prior to be commencement of the investigation
            - stages
